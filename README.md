Instructions: tap on the water/sewage surface to bump chlorine bricks that get thrown in. 
The longer you stay chlorine-free, the more you GROW. The goal is to spill over the vat walls 
(which are 6 meters high). If the water is clean, it drains, thus pushing you further away
from your goal. Don't fall below 1 meter.
